# Hi, I'm Bohdan 👋

## 🚀 About Me
Software Engineer (M.Sc.) with a strong focus on **Backend & Platform Engineering**.  
I work primarily with **Java and Rust**, building **scalable, high-performance backend services**, clean APIs, and reliable systems.

My background in **mobile and cross-platform development** (Android, iOS, React Native) gives me a strong understanding of how backend systems are consumed in real-world production environments — especially performance, stability, and API design.

📍 Based in **Germany (NRW)**

🏢 On-site, hybrid, or remote — **nationwide relocation possible**
